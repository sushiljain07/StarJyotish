"""
Long-term AI memory for signed-in users — the piece that turns "Ask the
Chart" from a stateless Q&A box into an astrologer who remembers you.

Two halves:

  get_memory_summary(db, user_id)
      Read side — fetch the user's current distilled memory so
      routes/kundli.py can hand it to ask_chart() as prompt context.

  update_memory_after_exchange(user_id, question, answer)
      Write side — fold the newest Q&A exchange into the rolling summary
      with one small LLM call. Designed to run as a FastAPI BackgroundTask
      *after* the response has been sent: it opens its own DB session
      (the request's get_db_optional session is already closed by then)
      and swallows every failure, because losing one memory update must
      never surface as an error on a question that was already answered.

The summary is deliberately capped (~150 words) so injecting it into every
future prompt has constant cost regardless of how many conversations the
relationship accumulates. Raw transcripts live in ChatMessage; this is the
derived, bounded "what I know about you" — see db/models/user_memory.py.

CURRENT MEMORY (may be empty):

NEWEST EXCHANGE ({today}):
Client asked: {question}
Astrologer answered: {answer}

Rewrite the memory to fold in anything genuinely worth remembering from this exchange:
- life concerns, goals, and decisions they are weighing (job change, marriage, health, family, money)
- concrete life events or situations they mentioned, with dates where known (write absolute dates, e.g. "July 2026", never "recently")
- personal preferences about how they like guidance
- open threads worth following up on later

Rules:
- Maximum 150 words. Plain prose or short dashes, no headings.
- Keep still-relevant facts from the current memory; drop what the newest exchange makes obsolete.
- Do NOT store chart facts (signs, houses, dashas) — those are recomputed from the birth chart every time.
- Do NOT store the astrologer's predictions — only what the CLIENT revealed or asked about.
- If this exchange revealed nothing personal worth keeping, reply with exactly: {sentinel}

Reply with the updated memory text only — no preamble."""
