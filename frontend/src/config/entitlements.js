// Stub entitlement system for the Rajyogas / Career Report paywall.
//
// There is currently no real payment or account backend — see the Master
// Execution Plan's Phase 3 (Postgres) and Phase 4 (Razorpay). This module
// exists so the locked-tab UI can be built and shipped now, with exactly
// one function body to swap out later: hasPremiumAccess(). Every component
// that gates on it stays unchanged when real payments land.
//
// Single paid tier for now — one purchase ("Full Report") unlocks both the
// Rajyogas tab and the Career Report tab together, matching the one price
// point that already exists in the product (₹499/₹999 CTA in the free
// Reading tab). Split into per-feature entitlements later only if you
// actually start selling them separately.

const DEV_UNLOCK_KEY = 'starjyotish_dev_unlock'

// Master switch. Set VITE_PAYWALL_ENABLED=false in .env to go back to
// today's fully-open behaviour everywhere, with no component changes.
const PAYWALL_ENABLED = import.meta.env.VITE_PAYWALL_ENABLED !== 'false'

// Owner/developer convenience: visiting the app once with ?unlock=1 sets a
// localStorage flag that persists on this device/browser, so you can see
// real content behind the lock while everyone else still sees it locked.
// ?unlock=0 clears it again.
//
// This is NOT security — there's no backend check behind it yet, so it
// only hides/shows content client-side. Don't rely on it once a real paid
// tier exists; at that point this whole file's hasPremiumAccess() body
// should be replaced with a real entitlement check against the backend.
